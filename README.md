# JavaQaPraticals
Hi Team,

I hope you will be aware of Github or Git module in case you are not then please talk to me once. Eventually, we have started writing the Java programs so we need to learn using Git commands as well. 

I have created this repo so that each QA can submit their work for each session before the next session in the same repo while working on their separate branches.

For instance - Dhruv is working on assignment (Naming Convention - QA/Qa-Name)
Branch name will be - QA/DhruvSingh

We need to raise Pull Request that in next session how to do that.
